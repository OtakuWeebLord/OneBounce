    <h5>What is OneBounce?</h5>
    <p>
      OneBounce is a fun intense FFA group game where everyone gets in a circle and people are eliminated until only one remains. As implied in the name the ball is 
      only allowed to bounce onece befre it must be hit again. That being said the ball doesn't have to bounce onece in order to be hit agan, allowing for more agressive 
      plays
